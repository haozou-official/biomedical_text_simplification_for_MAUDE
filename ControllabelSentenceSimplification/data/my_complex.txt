a journal article was reviewed that contained information regarding a leadless pacemaker (lp). the authors described cases where implantation failed in one patient due to inadequate sensing (poor r wave), in one patient, the lp dislodged acutely following release of the tether and lodged in the left pulmonary artery. the device was successfully retrieved and two days later a lp was implanted successfully without complications, and one patient developed significant pleuritic chest pain post procedure. an echocardiogram showed no evidence of a pericardial effusion. the patient was discharged the following day with simple analgesia and the symptoms resolved spontaneously with no sequelae. the disposition of the devices associated with the first two events listed above is unknown at this time. further follow up did not yet yield any additional information. no further patient complications have been reported as a result of this event. additional manufacturer narrative: this information is based entirely on journal literature. this event occurred outside the us. all information provided is included in this report. patient information is limited due to confidentiality concerns. without a lot number or device serial number, the manufacturing date cannot be determined. since no device id was provided, it is unknown if this event has been previously reported. the baseline gender/age characteristic is male/78 years old. a request for additional information will be made and upon receipt a supplemental report will be submitted accordingly. leadless permanent pacing: a single centre australian experience heart lung and circulation 2019; 28(11):1677-1682. if information is provided in the future, a supplemental report will be issued. additional information was received through follow up. the event was previously reported through regulatory report number 9612164-2016-01063. the additional information learned is captured in this supplemental regulatory report. if information is provided in the future, a supplemental report will be issued.
it was reported that patient developed vegetation on leadless implantable pulse generator (ipg) which was diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiogram (tte). an infection of the right groin was also reported. the patient is a participant in the post approval clinical surveillance product surveillance registry. no further patient complications have been reported as a result of this event. additional manufacturer narrative: if information is provided in the future, a supplemental report will be issued.
it was reported that the patient experienced headaches, palpitations, chest pain, ventricular tachycardia and heart block as a result of inappropriate therapy caused by a leadless implantable pulse generator (ipg) sensing problem. the patient is a participant in the post approval clinical surveillance product surveillance registry. sensing settings were reprogrammed on multiple occasions but the sensing was still not optimal for the patient. the ipg sensing was ultimately programmed off and the ipg remains implanted. no further patient complications have been reported as a result of this event. additional manufacturer narrative: if information is provided in the future, a supplemental report will be issued.

it was reported that during implant of the leadless pacemaker, a stable position was unable to be achieved due to patient anatomy. it was further reported the device was deployed multiple times in the heart. the first placement had low r waves and high thresholds. the device was removed from the body after four placements and a clot was observed on the device and delivery cup. the device was flushed to clear and advanced in the body to attempt four more locations. the device was explanted and replaced. the patient was a participant in the (b)(6) clinical study. no patient complications have been reported as a result of this event. additional manufacturer narrative: if information is provided in the future, a supplemental report will be issued. if information is provided in the future, a supplemental report will be issued. if information is provided in the future, a supplemental report will be issued. product event summary: the device was returned and analyzed. analysis was performed and no anomalies were found.
it was reported that during implant procedure for implantable pulse generator (ipg), crossing tv with the delivery catheter was easy, however the delivery catheter always pointed towards inferior free wall. apex and septum was initially not possible to reach. after several attempts, the implantable pulse generator (ipg) was deployed in an apical place but quite inferior, as operator did not wan to apply too much pressure. parameters were not good. recapture was performed. physician decided to retreat to the right atrial to begin again, and managed to go high septal for placement. however, impedance was 2000 ohms and thresholds around 5 volts. delivery catheter was withdrawn and the cathode was surrounded by clots. due to the difficulty to withdraw the clots from delivery catheter and prolonged procedure, a second device was selected, and advanced directly to a mid septal position with acceptable parameters. no patient complications have been reported as a result of this event. additional manufacturer narrative: if information is provided in the future, a supplemental report will be issued. product event summary: the device was returned, analyzed and no anomalies were found.
it was reported that during the implant of the leadless implantable pulse generator (ipg) about eight to ten positions were attempted throughout the procedure with multiple measurements on each to recheck. initial positioning was directly on the septum but with difficulty due to the catheter continuously advancing down towards the apex due to the shape of the heart. good fixation was seen under fluoroscopy but measurements were not sufficient, measurements were rechecked and still no significant change. numerous subsequent positions were tried with the similar results in measurements. fixation was very good throughout except for one position upon which recapture was quickly carried out. during about the sixth reposition, measurements although not perfect were considered to be reasonable given the difficulties of finding good measurements previously. the physician waited sometime at this point to see if the threshold came down. the position although very clearly fixated with three tines was not ideal as it was very high on the septum/outflow tract but due to such previous difficulties, it was decided to wait and recheck. the threshold was variable when checked but seemed okay. the decision was made to stick with this position. however at the point of the tether being cut, the threshold increased. the tether was clamped and it was decided to not stick with this position. two more positions were attempted with similar results of good fixation and extremely poor measurements. the case was abandoned at this point. the patient is to be rescheduled for a standard ipg. no patient complications have been reported as a result of this event. additional manufacturer narrative: if information is provided in the future, a supplemental report will be issued. product event summary: the device was returned and analyzed. analysis was performed and no anomalies were found. analysis of the device memory indicated a r-wave amplitude measurement issue.r-wave measurement of 1.4 mv recorded on 2016-04-20 is less than the recommended value of greater than or equal to 5 mv per the clinical manual.
it was reported that when the leadless pacemaker was initially deployed, a pull and hold test revealed the device was not in the desired location. the physician attempted several times to retrieve the device into the delivery catheter but was unsuccessful. resistance in retrieval was observed. the device was removed without being retrieved into the delivery catheter. the device was not implanted and a new leadless pacemaker was implanted. no patient complications have been reported as a result of this event. additional manufacturer narrative: if information is provided in the future, a supplemental report will be issued. product event summary: the device was returned, analyzed and no anomalies were found.
it was reported that the patient's leadless pacemaker exhibited elevated thresholds. it was also reported that the thresholds had increased from .88v at implant to 2.13v at the 6 month clinic visit. the leadless pacemaker remains in use. the patient is a participant in the (b)(6) clinical study. no patient complications have been reported as a result of this event. additional manufacturer narrative: if information is provided in the future, a supplemental report will be issued.
it was reported that there was elevated threshold, abnormally decreased battery voltage and longevity on the leadless implantable pulse generator (ipg). the ipg remain in use. the patient is enrolled in the (b)(6) post-market clinical study. no patient complications have been reported as a result of this event. additional manufacturer narrative: if information is provided in the future, a supplemental report will be issued.
